From cryptography, error correction, and recommendation systems to black holes and 
superluminal communication, quantum computing provides a rich platform for discourse between 
computer scientists and physicists. The broader field of quantum information also brings 
together mathematicians, electrical engineers, material scientists, and even philosophers.
And the technology inspired by these ideas attracts tech firms such as IBM, Microsoft, and 
Google, in addition to government agencies including NASA. Startups racing to invent the first 
practical quantum computer are appearing as well. 

The future outlook on quantum computing is indeed promising, but there is still much progress to 
be made. After all, the prestigious title of “neoclassical computing” is still waiting to be
conferred.
